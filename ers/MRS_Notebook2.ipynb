    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide a series of realistic example for running the JWST pipeline on large quantities of MIRI MRS data similar to those that will be obtained by many Cycle 1 observing programs.  In particular, we focus on handling issues related to multi-band ditheredobservations spanning the MRS wavelength range, both as regards efficient reduction times and data display issues.  We therefore do not discuss the purpose and input/output of each individual pipeline step, but focus on ways to modify the final pipeline output for the best scientific utility.  For a walkthrough of individual steps, see Notebook #1.  Similarly, this will cover the baseline pipeline as it exists in May 2021 and does not touch advanced algorithms or steps still under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is specifically for POINT-SOURCE observations; extended source observations are somewhat different and will be presented in MRS Notebook #3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple simulated MRS extended source observation (created using mirisim: https://wiki.miricle.org/Public/MIRISim_Public) with a dedicated background, process the data through the Detector1 pipeline (which turns raw detector counts into uncalibrated rate images), the Spec2 pipeline (which turns uncalibrated rate images into calibrated rate images), and the Spec3 pipeline (which turns calibrated rate images into composite data cubes and extracted 1d spectra).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional caveats:\n",
    "- This notebook covers the v1.2.0 baseline pipeline as it existed in May 2021.  The pipeline is under continuous development and there are therefore some changes in the latest pipeline build that will not be reflected here.\n",
    "- Likewise, there are some advanced algorithms slated for development prior to cycle 1 observations that will not be discussed here."

The point source spectrum is chosen to be astrophysically realistic, in this case taken from the galaxy NGC 5728.\n",

    "As noted above, in this notebook we will be processing simulated data created with the 'mirisim' tool.  Like the pipeline, mirisim is also an evolving piece of software and there are multiple known issues that can cause problems.  A few of the most important such mirisim issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- FAST mode has incorrect noise properties, rendering FAST mode data processed by the pipeline unreliable.  The simulations in this notebook therefore use simulated SLOW mode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended sources are not simulated unless they meet a minimum size that varies with each band.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point sources are not simulated properly, with the PSF profile being simulated incorrectly in the cores.  Mirisim simulations therefore should not be used to study the PSF shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference pixels are not treated consistently, the refpix step of detector1 must therefore be turned off to process mirisim data without artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Channel 4 flux calibration is incorrect in mirisim.  No workaround is currently available- channel 4 fluxes provided by the pipeline from simulated data will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WCS alignment is incorrect in mirisim, causing sources to jump in location by a couple of pixels between channels.  No workaround is available- do not use mirisim data to test spatial alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flux conservation is not perfect within mirisim.  Likewise, the aperture correction factors in use by the pipeline correspond to the expected performance in flight (to be updated during on-orbit commissioning) and are not well matched to mirisim data.  No workaround available, do not use mirisim data to test flux conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mirisim does not add all of the necessary header keywords for the pipeline to know how to do background subtraction, identify source type, etc.  In order to get these APT-derived keywords correct they will need to be set manually."

    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we set things up a number of necessary things in order for the pipeline to run successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll set the CRDS context; this dictates the versions of various pipeline reference files to use.  Ordinarily you wouldn't want to set a specific version as the latest pipeline should already use the most-recent reference files (and hard-coding a version could get you old reference files that have since been replaced).  However, it's included here as a reference for how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll import the various python packages that we're actually going to use in this notebook, including both generic utility functions and the actual pipeline modules themselves.  This includes a variety of multiprocessing functions that allow us to parallelize pipeline reductions of many exposures using the multiple cores now standard in many computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll specify the data directory structure that we want to use.  In order to keep our filesystem clean we'll separate simulated inputs and outputs from each pipeline stage into their own folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for convenience in this JWebbinar we'll define a flag that sets whether or not to actually run some of the longer pipeline steps in this notebook or just to rely upon cached reductions provided ahead of time.  This is because a number of steps (particularly building 3d data cubes) can take quite a long time to run, and in a short Webbinar we don't want to be waiting for them to all run in real time.  This flag is set to False by default for use in the live Webbinar; if you want to experiment with running all steps yourself ahead of time just set this flag to True.  Total notebook runtime with True/False values is about 6 hours (8 CPUs; roughly 20 hours with just 1 CPU) vs 10 seconds."

Since cubes can only use a spaxel size in the spatial dimension, a single cube combining both Channel 1 and Channel 4 must therefore either dramatically undersample the data at Ch1 or dramatically oversample the data at Ch4.
