    "#### Task 1:  Load the MOS data and view it\n",
    "* Load the NIRSpec MOS spectra and image cutouts into Mosviz using the code cells below\n",
    "* Click on the third row (not the checkbox) in the Mosviz table viewer to display data for one of the sources in the MOS dataset.\n",
    "* Open the Display menu of the Image viewer. In the Layer tab, change the stretch to Square Root, 99.5 percentile.\n",
    "* Try adjusting the stretch and colormap in the 2D spectrum viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2:  Toggle the slit viewer on and off\n",
    "* Find the Slit Overlay Plugin by clicking the icon at upper right corner of the application.\n",
    "* Uncheck or check the box to turn the slit viewer off or on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 3: Select a spectral region for further analysis\n",
    "* Use the horizontal and vertical pan-zoom tools in the 1D spectrum viewer to zoom in on the spectral line at 2 microns.  Note that the 2D spectral region matches the selection in the 1D viewer.\n",
    "* Use the spectral region selection tool in the 1D spectrum viewer to select the line at 2 microns (Subset 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 4: Measure line centroids using the Line Analysis plugin\n",
    "* Find the Line Analysis Plugin by clicking the 'Lego' icon at upper right.\n",
    "* Select a dataset with the Data dropdown (e.g. Subset1).\n",
    "* Several line properties are automatically computed (flux, equivalent width, Gaussian sigma, Gaussian FWHM, and Centroid) using specutils functionality. Note that the line flux, Gaussian sigma, FWHM, and centroid require continuum subtraction or normalization, and will not be correct if there is a significant continuum component. The equivalent width, on the other hand, requires the continuum to be normalized to unity to give a correct answer. \n",
    "* The Halpha emission line complex is at 1.92 microns (redshift z = 1.93) \n",
    "* Now determine the centroid wavelength of the line at ~1.5 microns.  What is the line ID?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 5: Identify spectral lines using the Line Lists plugin\n",
    "* Open the Line Lists plugin to create a custom line list: OIII5007 (1.467 um), Halpha (1.923 um)\n",
    "* Click on the 'Custom' tab and enter the first line name, wavelength, and wavelength unit, and click 'Add Line'\n",
    "* In the same place, enter the values for the second line and 'Add Line'\n",
    "* Click through the other spectra to see if those same lines appear (Hint: it is one of the first 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 6: Load a line list from the notebook and display them in the spectrum viewer\n",
    "* Run the cell below to load a custom line list programmatically\n",
    "* Open the Line Lists plugin\n",
    "* Change the color of the 'Galaxy3' line list to distinguish from the 'Custom' line list\n",
    "* Click on Hide/Show All in the Galaxy3 line list to toggle lines on and off\n",
    "* Check/uncheck individual lines to show only the ones you want\n"
