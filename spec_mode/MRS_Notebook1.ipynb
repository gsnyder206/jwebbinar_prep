    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide an introduction to JWST spectroscopic mode data reduction, focusing on the specific use case of the integral-field unit (IFU) observing mode.  As a demonstration case we use IFU data for the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) IFU; while many of the pipeline steps are similar for both MIRI and NIRSpec IFUs we note differences where they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple simulated MRS point source observation (created using mirisim: https://wiki.miricle.org/Public/MIRISim_Public), process the data through the Detector1 pipeline (which turns raw detector counts into uncalibrated rate images), the Spec2 pipeline (which turns uncalibrated rate images into calibrated rate images), and the Spec3 pipeline (which turns calibrated rate images into composite data cubes and extracted 1d spectra).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Detector1 pipeline has been discussed extensively in previous JWebbinars we will not dig into that stage of the pipeline in detail, and focus instead on the Spec2 and Spec3 stages.  We will step individually through each step in these two pipeline stages, discuss how they work, and examine some sample outputs.  Since we'll be examining each step individually, this notebook is thus not a good template to use for designing your own notebook to process/inspect large quantities of observational data.  This use case is more directly addressed by MRS Calibration Notebooks #2 and #3 (point sources and extended sources respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional caveats:\n",
    "- This notebook covers the v1.3.2 baseline pipeline as it existed in October 2021.  The pipeline is under continuous development and there are therefore some changes in the latest pipeline build that will not be reflected here.\n",
    "- Likewise, there are some advanced algorithms slated for development prior to cycle 1 observations that will not be discussed here."

    "As noted above, in this notebook we will be processing simulated data created with the 'mirisim' tool.  Like the pipeline, mirisim is also an evolving piece of software and there are multiple known issues that can cause problems.  A few of the most important such mirisim issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- FAST mode has incorrect noise properties, rendering FAST mode data processed by the pipeline unreliable.  The simulations in this notebook therefore use simulated SLOW mode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended sources are not simulated unless they meet a minimum size that varies with each band.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point sources are not simulated properly, with the PSF profile being simulated incorrectly in the cores.  Mirisim simulations therefore should not be used to study the PSF shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference pixels are not treated consistently, the refpix step of detector1 must therefore be turned off to process mirisim data without artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Channel 4 flux calibration is incorrect in mirisim.  No workaround is currently available- channel 4 fluxes provided by the pipeline from simulated data will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WCS alignment is incorrect in mirisim, causing sources to jump in location by a couple of pixels between channels.  No workaround is available- do not use mirisim data to test spatial alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flux conservation is not perfect within mirisim.  Likewise, the aperture correction factors in use by the pipeline correspond to the expected performance in flight (to be udpated during on-orbit commissioning) and are not well matched to mirisim data.  No workaround available, do not use mirisim data to test flux conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mirisim does not add all of the necessary header keywords for the pipeline to know how to do background subtraction, identify source type, etc.  In order to get these APT-derived keywords correct they will need to be set manually."

This is because some steps can take quite a long time to run, and in a short Webbinar we don't want to be waiting for them to all run in real time.  This flag is set to False by default for use in the live Webbinar; if you want to experiment with running all steps yourself ahead of time just set this flag to True.  Total notebook runtime with True/False values is about 15 minutes vs 6 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this runtime reflects substantial gains in the speed of 3d cube building in the build 1.3.2 JWST pipeline, which now uses C routines to perform cube building instead of pure python.  Previously, total notebook runtime was approximately 1.5 hours."
